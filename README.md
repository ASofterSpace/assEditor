# assEditor

**Class:** A Softer Space Internal

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows or Linux Desktop

This is an editor for our internal use at a softer space, but it should be generic enough such that others might benefit from it too.
The main idea is to get it to be fast and full of useful features - with "fast" always being the more important of these two directives. ;)

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
./build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the assEditor after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
./run.sh
```

## Alias

You can add an alias to bash under Linux to call this more easily, e.g.:

alias ae='/absolute/path/to/assEditor/run.sh'

If you put this line into ~/.bashrc, it the alias ae will be available in every bash session.
